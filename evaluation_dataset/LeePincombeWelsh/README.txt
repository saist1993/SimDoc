Lee, M.D., Pincombe, B.M., & Welsh, M.B. (2005). An empirical evaluation of models of text document similarity. In B.G. Bara, L.W. Barsalou & M. Bucciarelli, (Eds.),  Proceedings of the 27th Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society, pp. 1254-1259. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.

The file LeePincombeWelshDocuments.txt contains the full text of the 50 documents, numbered according to their order in the data set.

The file LeePincobmeWelshData.csv list all of the similarity ratings. Each row is a rating, and contains 5 columns. The first column is a SubjectID, the second column is the first document number of the pair, the third column is the second document number of the pair, the fourth column is the similarity rating, and the fifth column is the response time in seconds. Each subject could do as many or few rating as they wanted, and the pairs presented were generated randomly, under the intended constraint of generating a total of 10 judgments for every document pairing (and see the paper for the glitch in that plan).
